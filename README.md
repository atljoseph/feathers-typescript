# feathersjs-typescript

Example app with basic feathersjs express api with typescript.
All the others I found online were crappy.
This one is a work in progress ...

## Install and Run

`git clone <repo-url>`
`npm i`
`npm i -g typescript`
`npm start`

## Built with the feathers cli

`npm i -g @feathers/cli`
`feathers generate app`
